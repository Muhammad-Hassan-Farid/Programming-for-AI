              "summary": "{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 2225,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Millions go missing at China bank\\n \\n Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (\\u00c2\\u00a364m) went missing.\\n \\n The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut\\n \\n however a report in the china-published economic observer said on monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in new york because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the enron scandal bank of china is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer while china construction bank is the largest deposit holder china's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data though most observers believe the true figure is far higher officially one in five loans is not being repaid attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours the most high-profile case involved the ex-president of bank of china wang xuebing jailed for 12 years in 2003 although he committed the offences whilst running bank of china in new york mr wang was head of china construction bank when the scandal broke earlier this month a china construction bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case\\n \\n china's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness the introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector but links between banks and local government remain strong last year china's premier wen jiabao targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending china's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of china's economic boom but two problems persist first inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people second many questionable loans come not from the big four but from smaller banks another high profile financial firm china life is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the us securities and exchange commission following its 2004 new york listing

\"text messages aid disaster recovery\\n \\n text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia\\n \\n the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast cell phone signals were weak land lines were unreliable so mr senanayake started sending out text messages the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \\\"who needs what and where\\\" blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent\\n \\n and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use \\\"sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call\\\" he says\\n \\n \\\"in every rural community there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages\\\" half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi's messages mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help mr rampersad said: \\\"imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect \\\"he can message the server so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field\\\" he added: \\\"or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places\\\"\\n \\n mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september last week he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia\\n \\n in only 72 hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help \\\"this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people\\\" says paul saffo a director at the california-based institute for the future \\\"you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away\\\" he said \\\"that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy\\\" it is still very early days for the project though in an e-mail dan lane calls it \\\"an early proof of concept\\\" right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page or distribute it to an e-mail list in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages but there's still another challenge you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use \\\"it's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that\\\" says mr rampersad \\\"so the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication\\\" he is optimistic however he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating\\n \\n clark boyd is technology

that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left    mr kilroy-silk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had \\\"gone awol\\\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections \\\"while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not\\\" he said \\\"i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in \\\"and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight\\\"    mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would \\\"deliver better\\\" as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney \\\"has a moral obligation if not a legal one\\\" to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk \\\"he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now 'goodbye'\\\" he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been \\\"straightforward\\\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead    this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further    thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election    it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting    ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk    if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another    so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow    interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name    every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come    well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it's all flash and no real policy here    let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity    veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
